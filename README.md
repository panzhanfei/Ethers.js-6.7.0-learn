Ethers.js learn

简介
本项目用于学习和探索 Ethers.js 版本 6.7.0 的相关知识和功能。Ethers.js 是一个强大的 JavaScript 库，用于与以太坊区块链进行交互，提供了丰富的 API 来处理钱包管理、合约调用、交易等操作。

学习过程中用了最简单最直观的方法 在html编写js代码 在浏览器运行index.html，用F12查看代码的输出结果

原本应该Ethers链接eth或者一些eth测试网 但为了方便快速的学习 我用的是链接ganache（可以理解为在本地搭建了eth，）这个本地工具，因为在sepolia等测试网上通过水龙头获取测试币比较麻烦。

Ethers.js learn

Introduction

This project is used to study and explore the relevant knowledge and functions of Ethers.js version 6.7.0. Ethers.js is a powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a rich set of APIs for handling wallet management, contract calls, transactions, and other operations.

During the learning process, the simplest and most intuitive method was adopted. JavaScript code was written in HTML, and the index.html file was run in a browser. The output results of the code were viewed using the F12 key.

Originally, Ethers should have been used to connect to the Ethereum mainnet or some Ethereum testnets. However, for the convenience and quickness of learning, I used Ganache (which can be understood as setting up Ethereum locally), this local tool. This is because it is rather troublesome to obtain test tokens through faucets on testnets such as Sepolia.
